# All these sections are optional. Each section with the exception of [general] represents
# one rule and each key in it is an option for that specific rule.
#
# Rules and sections can be referenced by their full name or by id. For example
# section "[body-max-line-length]" could also be written as "[B1]". Full section names are
# used in here for clarity.
